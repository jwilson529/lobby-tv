# Lobby TV

This repository contains a WordPress plugin that will power Centerstone's lobby TV digital signage experience. The MVP goals, architecture, data model, and rollout plan are documented in [`docs/mvp-plan.md`](docs/mvp-plan.md).

## Getting Started

This project uses the WordPress Plugin Boilerplate structure. Development setup and build tooling will be defined as implementation proceeds. For now, review the MVP plan to understand the core concepts, REST API surface, and next steps.
